PySharpGTK - Because I hate whoever decided that WinForms are required in this course

  </div>
 
### Purpose
This organization contains the repositories needed for PySharpGTK to function.  

### Help us out!
If you are part of the Inholland University, please contact your head/programming teachers and tell them about this project and how it was created because of the WinForms sanctimoniousness. Currently, students are either forced to use Winforms (Based!), use a virtual machine (Slow...), or even buy a new laptop with a staggering high price tag. We believe that we deserve better than the standards given by this school.

# Alternatively

If you have experience in coding, you can help support our cause by creating a pull request with your desired features! 
We appreciate it!

# Thank you ;P
